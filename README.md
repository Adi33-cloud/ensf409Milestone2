## Usage

The ServerCom.java is the main class on the server side, and the ClientCom.java is the main class on the client side. First, compile and execute the ServerCom.java. Then, compile and execute the ClientCom.java for as many clients as you like. Each ClientCom.java will have its own GUI for the user.

If all goes well, the output of the program should be displayed/generated.
